# TaaS

TaaS, is a SaaS and Multitenancy Framework for dotNet. This framework aims to provide a tenant engine to help developers build software as a service (SaaS) applications that support multitenancy.

## Features
-	Support for multiple tenants: The framework allows you to easily create and manage multiple tenants within your application. Each tenant can have their own unique data and configuration settings.
-	Tenant isolation: The framework ensures that each tenant's data is isolated from other tenants, ensuring that one tenant's actions do not affect the data of another tenant.
-	Easy integration: The framework is designed to be easy to integrate into your existing C# application. It provides a simple API and a set of helper classes to make it easy to add multitenancy support to your application.
-	Customizable: The framework is highly customizable and can be tailored to fit the needs of your application. You can define custom tenant properties and configure the framework to meet the specific needs of your application.
